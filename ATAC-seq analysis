ATAC-seq bioinformatic analysis performed on Imperial HPC, unless stated otherwise

Technical replicate merging, adaptor trimming, fastqc, alignment and sorting/filtering are the same as steps 1-5 in ChIP-seq analysis section.

Subsequent steps taken after.

1. Additional sorting to remove mitochondrial reads

    module load samtools
    for file in path_to_sorted_files/sorted_files.bam
    do
    name=`basename $file .bam`
    samtools view -h $file | grep -v chrM | samtools view -h -b - > $name.nomito.bam
    done

2. Peak calling using macs2 with no input file

    module load anaconda3/personal
    for file in path_to_file/sorted_no_mitochondial_reads_file.bam
    do
    name=`basename $file .bl.dedup.sort.nomito.bam`
    macs2 callpeak -f BAMPE --nolambda -t $file -n $name
    done

Peaks intersections to generate files with 2/3 biological repeats, and in one file or another done the same way as in ChIP-seq analysis using bedtools intersect
